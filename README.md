This is the README.md file for Realms-Of-Python: Open Source Literate Python
Realms of Python delves into the extent and possibilities of computer programming, largely using Python.

'Literate' programming refers to a method of program writing that exposes the logic and structure of programs and software.
Literate programming is described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming

And literate programs are housed in literate projects.  

In Python, projects are normally housed as downloadable software using either pip or conda.

So this repository is to house 'realms' of literate projects what we often refer to as books and libraries.

The first of these book/libraries is called PyMath.  And PyMath itself contains lessons and code about mathematics.
